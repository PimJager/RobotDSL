Section~\ref{sec:process} described our plan for developing the mars rover
DSL and its instances. 

In the actual development phase we have moved faster than planned. At the end of
week 2 we had already implemented everything from the second sprint and F2, F3,
F4,, F5 and F9 from sprint 3. At the end of week 3 we had completely implemented
sprint 3 and sprint 4. Week 4 was then spend implementing F21, F22, and F7. 

\subsection{Final result}
Tables \ref{tbl:endFunctionalReq}, \ref{tbl:endUsabilityReq},
\ref{tbl:endReliabilityReq}, \ref{tbl:endPerformanceReq} 
and \ref{tbl:endSupportabilityReq} show the conformance of the final product to
the requirements of section~\ref{sec:requirements}. In these tables `V' is means
the product met the requirement, `X' means it does not meet the requirement and
`?' means it is not objectively clear if the product meets the requirement. 
Each requirement which does not have a `Would' priority and is not marked with
`V' will be discussed.

\begin{description}
	\item[R2 - `?'] The sensor readings from the robot are reliable and 
		consistent enough. However they are not calibrated at the start of a
		mission and especially the color sensor can report wrong colors in some
		light conditions. Therefore the sensor readings aren't as fool proof as
		we would have liked.
	\item[R3 - `X'] The Robot can sometimes drive out of a lake, but under some
		conditions it can not. Instead we have opted to implement F6 very 
		well, to stop the robot from driving into lakes in the first place.
	\item[P2 - `?'] The Robot is able to complete missions in a timely fashion,
		however we have not spend much time optimising this speed, therefore
		it might be possible that the robot can complete the missions faster 
		while still staying safe.
	\item[P3 - `X'] We have spend little effort minimising the robots movement
		and although the robot doesn't do a lot of unnecessary movement, some 
		assumptions -such as always turning right to avoid danger- cause the
		robot to move more than necessary.
	\item[S2 - `X'] It is currently not possible to add extra sensors or 
		actuators to the robot without changing the DSL.
