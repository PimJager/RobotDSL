To program the Mars Rover in an efficient manner we have constructed a DSL which
allows the programmer to write missions for the mars rover. This DSL abstracts
over the various specifics which are needed for every program for the mars 
rover, such as managing the Bluetooth connection, setting up sensors, reading
sensor values, etc. \\  

The DSL is a very powerful one, which allows the programmer to write complicated
programs using variables, constants, conditional statements and subroutines. 
This way the DSL does not restrict the programmer too much in the type of 
programs that can be expressed, but instead supports the programmer by 
abstracting over the commonly used functionality. \\
